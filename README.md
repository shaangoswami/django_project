textUTILS is my first Django-Python Project. It is an interactive website using HTML and Python. It is a backend and frontend working Web.

textUTILS is simply a set of utility functions to do operations on String objects. textUTILS is a Django website built primarily to do various operations like Extra space remove, New Line remove, Punctuations remove, and fully Uppercase the text. User can do any of these operations with text.
